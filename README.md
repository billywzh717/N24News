# N24News
 
This is the code for our paper [N24News: A New Dataset for Multimodal News Classification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.13327.pdf),
which has been accepted by the 13th Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC 2022).

## Build complete dataset

The build_fully_dataset.py can be used to download the complete version
of N24News. Place nytimes_dataset.json in the same place and run the py file.

Once finished, the images will be stored in the 'images' folder and the name 
of images correspond to the 'image_id' in the json file.
